## Product Description (Detailed)

JsonBoard v1.4.0 introduces **Drizzle-Style Schema Management** - the easiest way to get type-safe JSON validation in your TypeScript projects.

### üéØ The Problem
Working with JSON files means choosing between:
- ‚ùå No type safety (runtime errors waiting to happen)
- ‚ùå Manual Zod schema writing (time-consuming and error-prone)
- ‚ùå Full database setup (overkill for prototypes and small projects)

### ‚úÖ The Solution
One command generates complete TypeScript schemas for all your JSON files:

```bash
npx jsonboard --init-schema --dir ./data
```

### üöÄ What You Get
- **Zod Schemas**: Runtime validation for every JSON file
- **TypeScript Types**: Full compile-time safety with z.infer<>
- **Validation Functions**: Pre-built helpers with error handling
- **Smart Naming**: Automatic conflict resolution
- **Single File**: Clean, maintainable jsonboard.schema.ts

### üíª Perfect For
- JAMstack sites (Next.js, Nuxt, Gatsby)
- API mocking and testing
- Rapid prototyping
- Configuration management
- Content management
- Team data contracts

### üé™ Bonus: Visual JSON Editor
JsonBoard also includes a spreadsheet-like GUI for editing JSON files - think phpMyAdmin for JSON. But the schema generation works completely standalone.

## Maker Comment

"I built JsonBoard because I was tired of choosing between type safety and simplicity when working with JSON files. 

For prototypes and JAMstack sites, setting up Drizzle or Prisma feels like overkill. But manual JSON editing and missing types always leads to bugs.

JsonBoard v1.4.0 gives you the best of both worlds - the developer experience of modern ORMs with the simplicity of JSON files. One command and you have complete type safety.

I've been using it in my own projects and it's saved me hours of manual schema writing. Hope it helps other developers too!"
