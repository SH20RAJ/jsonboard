## General Questions

### What is JsonBoard?
JsonBoard is a local-first, zero-setup visual database for your JSON files. It provides a spreadsheet-like interface to manage JSON data without the complexity of traditional databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

### Why should I use JsonBoard?
- **Zero Setup**: No database installation, no configuration files, no connection strings
- **Local-First**: Your data stays in your codebase, never uploaded anywhere
- **Visual Interface**: Edit JSON like a spreadsheet instead of manual text editing
- **Developer-Friendly**: Perfect for prototypes, MVPs, and rapid development
- **Open Source**: Community-driven, extensible, and free forever

### How is JsonBoard different from traditional databases?
| JsonBoard | Traditional Databases |
|-----------|----------------------|
| ✅ Zero setup | ❌ Complex installation |
| ✅ File-based | ❌ Server-based |
| ✅ Git-friendly | ❌ Requires dumps/migrations |
| ✅ Visual editing | ❌ SQL/query knowledge required |
| ✅ No dependencies | ❌ Runtime dependencies |
